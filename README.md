# Animelist v.01

Hello there! this animelist app is based on the knowledge obtained in the courses [CSS Grid Layout](https://platzi.com/cursos/css-grid-layout/) and [React.js Course](https://platzi.com/cursos/react/) given by [Leonidas Esteban](https://leonidasesteban.com/) this is the code base for the future functional app, please if you're going to use any algorithm of this project, go ahead and use it, but let a reference to the creator (me) at least.

For my personal challenge, i decided to code an anime "search engine" application, similary like the thinking "what anime to watch", the app it's made with the create-react-app boilerplate.

# Project

As i said, the project its coded by the create-react-app boilerplate and using the basics of React.JS, it works with the [kitsu](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/) API's, the documentaci√≥n is well done and is really extensive, if you want to code your own anime application, please use their API's!
no, i mean, seriously, stop reading and go check em' out.
